# Symbolic-Emergence-Field-Analysis-SEFA-
"Symbolic emergence" in SEFA refers to the spontaneous appearance of distinct, coherent, and interpretable structures within a field, as detected by the SEFA score. These structures are not imposed externally but arise from the internal geometry and information content of the field.
